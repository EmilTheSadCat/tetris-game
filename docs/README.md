# Tetris

Implementation of classic tetris game. Written entirely in Vanilla Javascript using Canvas API. 
The styling is inspired by retro pixel games.

## Installing / Getting started


```shell
npm install

npm start   <--- start development server

npm run build   <--- build production bundle in ./dist directory
```


Click on the board or press 'P' and the game will start!
Controls instruction is displayed in the game.

Try to destroy more than one row at once. With each additional row you will multiply your points!

Beware, desktop only!
